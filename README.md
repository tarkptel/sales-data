# sales-data_analysis
This is my first project on Github. 
In this project I have done data cleaning and data visualization using libraries like pandas and seaborn.
In which I removed unwanted columns in data cleaning.
In data visualization I did plotting between different columns. 
In which it was found that who bought more from male or female?
How much was purchased from the same group?
How much was purchased from which state?
Which product sold more? etc.

Thank you for landing on my project......
